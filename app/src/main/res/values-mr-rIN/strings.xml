    <string name="struct">Vision is one among the five senses and eyes are the window through which we can see the world. Often we ignore the importance of the eye and act lazy in taking care of our eyes.</string>
    <string name="struct1">Eyes are situated within a bony socket in the skull. The eye consists of the following parts</string>
    <string name="struct2">Eyelids can be described as a curtain of tissue placed in front of the eyes. Upper and lower eyelids together with eyelashes protect our eyes from sunlight, dust falling in our eyes, and from ocular injuries. </string>
    <string name="struct3">The white portion of the eye that is seen on the outer surface is called the sclera. Sclera protects the inner part of our eyes.</string>
    <string name="struct4">The cornea is the transparent structure placed centrally in front of our eyes. Light enters our eyes through the cornea. </string>
    <string name="struct5">Iris is the circular band located behind the cornea. The color of the iris can vary from black, brown, or blue. The function of the iris is similar to the diaphragm of a camera. It controls the amount of light reaching to the back of the eye i.e. retina. </string>
    <string name="struct6">The pupil is the small aperture seen in the middle of iris. The light passes through pupil to reach the retina</string>
    <string name="struct7">The lens is the transparent structure placed inside the eye. It helps in focusing of light on the retina</string>
    <string name="struct8">The retina is the place where all the light entering the eye falls and forms the image of the object. The retina is the innermost layer of the layer located at the back of the eye</string>
    <string name="struct9">The optic nerve carries the image formed by retina towards the brain, where the image is processed </string>
    <string name="struct10">The working of the human eye is similar to that of a camera. Light enters the eye through the eye aperture called pupil and travels through the lens and forms an image on the retina. The image formed on the retina is carried towards the brain through the optic nerve.  Defects in any of these structures can result in the dimension of vision and can even result in blindness.</string>
